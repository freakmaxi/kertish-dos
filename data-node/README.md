# Kertish DOS Data Node

Data node is responsible to store file blocks and serve when they requested.
Default bind endpoint port is `:9430`

Should be started with parameters that are set as environment variables

### Environment Variables
- `BIND_ADDRESS` (optional) : Service binding address. Ex: `127.0.0.1:9430` Default: `:9430`

- `MANAGER_ADDRESS` (mandatory) : Manager Node accessing endpoint. Ex: `http://127.0.0.1:9400`

Manager address will be used to notify create and delete operations for the file block synchronization between
all data-nodes in the cluster.

- `SIZE` (mandatory) : The size limit of the node. All the data nodes should be the same size if they'll be used in the
same cluster. Size value should be uint64 and byte format. Ex: `1073741824` for 1Gb

- `ROOT_PATH` (optional) : The path to store file blocks. Default: `/opt`

- `CACHE_LIMIT` (optional): Small sized files can be cached for fast access. Value should be uint64 in byte format
Default: `0` (disabled)

- `CACHE_LIFETIME` (optional): Cache lifetime. When cache reaches to the end of its lifetime, garbage collector will
free up the memory. Value should be uint64 in minutes. Default: `360` (6 hours)

### Data Node
Data nodes are smart enough to sync each other. Every create and delete request will be distributed between nodes
using the manager as a gateway. On the first run, if manager node is not accessible, it will start as stand-alone. When 
manager node becomes available, they will automatically join the related cluster. **NOTE Slave nodes may or may not sync
itself with the master node when they restarted.**
